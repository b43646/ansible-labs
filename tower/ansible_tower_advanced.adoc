== Introduction to Ansible Tower Clustering

With version 3.1 Ansible Tower introduced clustering, replacing the redundancy solution configured with the active-passive nodes. Clustering is sharing load between Tower nodes/instances. Each Tower instance is able to act as an entry point for UI and API access.

TIP: Using a load balancer in front of the Tower nodes is possible, but optional because an Ansible Tower cluster can be accessed via all Tower instances.

Each instance in a Tower cluster expands the cluster's capacity to execute jobs. Jobs can and will run anywhere rather than be directed on where to run.

=== Setup Considerations

Here are a number of things to consider when planning a clustered Tower deployment:

* The PostgreSQL database is a central component of the cluster. Ansible Tower is not taking care of availabilty, redundancy or replication of the database, this has to be configured "outside" of Tower.
* The number of instances in a cluster should always be an *odd number* and a minimum number of three is strongly recommended with a maximum of 20.
* RabbitMQ is a core component, so a lot of the requirements are dictated by it. Like e.g. the odd node count for quorum...
* Typical cluster considerations apply: All nodes need to be able to reliably connect to each other, stable address/hostname resolution, geographically co-located with reliable low-latency connections between instances.
* Remember there is no concept of primary/secondary instance, all systems are primary.

== Installing an Ansible Tower Cluster

For initial configuration of a Tower cluster and for adding new instances the default Ansible installer is used, but the inventory file needs to be extended. Some important basic concepts:

* There has to be at least an inventory group named `tower`. We'll cover instance groups later, but keep in mind the nodes in this group are responsible for housekeeping tasks like where to launch jobs or to process playbook events.
* If all Tower instances in this group fail, jobs might not run and playbook events might not get written. So make sure there are enough instances in this group.
* The database can be installed and configured by the installer by adding the host to the `database` group. If the database host is provisioned separately, leave the group empty.

=== The Installer Inventory File

In this lab a three node Ansible Tower cluster is provided ready to go as installing it would eat too much of your lab time. It's pretty straight forward anyway. The inventory file here is just for giving you an idea what you are using here and for reference.

TIP: Keep in mind when working with clustered Ansible Tower that the database will not be clustered or replicated by the installer. This is something you have to take care of yourself.

----
[tower]
tower1.example.com
tower2.example.com
tower3.example.com

[database]
towerdb.example.com

[all:vars]

rabbitmq_password='r3dh4t1!'
rabbitmq_cookie=rabbitmqcookie
----

WARNING: In this lab this has been taken care of, but remember all instances have to able to resolve all hostnames and to reach each other!

== Know your Cluster

=== Access the Tower Web UI

For the first contact to your cluster open your browser and login to all three nodes web UIs (you'll have to accept the self-signed certificates):

WARNING: Replace the *<REPL>* string with your GUID!

* *https://tower1-<REPL>.rhpds.opentlc.com*
* *https://tower2-<REPL>.rhpds.opentlc.com*
* *https://tower3-<REPL>.rhpds.opentlc.com*

Just from the web UI you wouldn't know you've got a Tower cluster at your hands here. To learn more about your cluster and it's state, in one of the instances web UI under *ADMINISTRATION* choose *Instance Groups*. Here you will get an overview of the cluster by instance groups. Explore the information provided, of course there is no capacity used yet and now Jobs have run.

From this view you can already see the instance count is three, click on *INSTANCES* to get more information about your cluster's Tower instances. In the instances view you can toggle nodes off/online and adjust the number of forks.

=== Access you Tower Cluster via SSH

You can also get information about your cluster on the command line. In a terminal window, bring up an SSH session to your control host *control.example.com*:

----
# ssh root@control-<GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
----


From `control.example.com` jump to one of the Tower instances, e.g.:

----
[root@control ~]# ssh tower1.example.com
----

And run the following command:
----
[root@tower1 ~]# awx-manage list_instances
[tower capacity=177]
  tower1.example.com capacity=59 version=3.4.1 heartbeat="2019-02-26 15:00:25"
  tower3.example.com capacity=59 version=3.4.1 heartbeat="2019-02-26 15:00:15"
  tower2.example.com capacity=59 version=3.4.1 heartbeat="2019-02-26 15:00:07"

----

TIP: The *awx-manage* (formerly tower-manage) utility can be used to administer a lot of the more internal aspects of Tower. You can e.g. use it to clean up old data, for token and session management and for cluster management.

== There is more to Tower then the Web UI

This is an advanced Tower lab so we don't really want you to use the web UI for everything. Tower's web UI is well done and helps with a lot of tasks, but same as in system administration it's often handy to be able to use the command line or scripts for certain tasks.

We've incorporated different ways to work with Tower in this lab guide and hope you'll find it helpful. The first step we do is install the *tower-cli* utility.

TIP: *tower-cli* is an open source project currently under development and, until a complete implementation occurs, only implements a subset of Towerâ€™s features. Right now you can install `tower-cli` from Python Pip or from the EPEL repository.

We'll install it on your control host using locally cached RPM packages. Exit the SSH session to *tower1.example.com* or open a new one to the control host:

----
# ssh root@control-<GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
[root@control ~]# yum install python2-ansible-tower-cli -y
----

After installing the tool, you have to do some basic configuration:

----
[root@control ~]# tower-cli config host tower2.example.com
[root@control ~]# tower-cli config username admin
[root@control ~]# tower-cli config password r3dh4t1!
----

TIP: It doesn't really matter what node you have it talking to.

Now test *tower-cli* is working. First run it without arguments to get a list of resources you can manage with it:

----
[root@control ~]# tower-cli --help
----

And then test something, e.g.:

----
[root@control ~]# tower-cli inventory list
----

TIP: When trying to find a *tower-cli* command line for something you want to do, just move one by one.

Example:

----
tower-cli --help
----

Okay, there is an *inventory* resource. Let's see...

----
tower-cli inventory --help
----

Well, *create* sounds like what I had in mind. But what arguments do I need?

----
tower-cli inventory create
----

Bingo! Take note of the *REQUIRED* mark.

TIP: When you start using *tower-cli* this file is very helpful as it provides a lot of examples: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/tower-cli/master/docs/source/cli_ref/examples/fake_data_creator.sh

=== Challenge Lab: tower-cli

To practice your *tower-cli* skills, here is a challenge:

* Try to change the *idle time out* of the Tower web UI, it's 1800 seconds by default. Set it to, say, 7200. Using *tower-cli*, of course.

* Start by looking for a resource type *tower-cli* provides using *--help* that sounds like it has something to do with changing config settings.

* Look at the available *tower-cli* commands for this resource type.

* Use the commands to have a look at the parameters settings and change it.

TIP: The configuration parameter is called *SESSION_COOKIE_AGE*

WARNING: *SOLUTION BELOW!*

----
tower-cli settings
tower-cli setting get SESSION_COOKIE_AGE
tower-cli setting modify SESSION_COOKIE_AGE 7200
tower-cli setting get SESSION_COOKIE_AGE
----

If you want to, go to the web UI and check the setting under *ADMINISTRATION->Settings->System*.

== Creating Inventory and Credentials

The next steps don't really differ from what you would do with a single-instance Tower. To run Ansible jobs from Tower you need an inventory and machine credentials.

=== Create an Inventory

As said we don't really want you to go to the web UI to configure your static inventory. I mean, if you really want to, go ahead. But here we'll use *tower-cli* to create an inventory, we'll get to dynamic inventories later on.

First create the inventory in Tower using *tower-cli*. Try to get the proper invocation of *tower-cli* yourself and create an inventory name *Example Inventory* (yup, very creative, we know).

TIP: *tower-cli* behaves pretty UNIXy, just use *--help* to get down to the needed command.

WARNING: *Solution Below*!

----
[root@control ~]# tower-cli inventory create --name "Example Inventory" --organization "Default"
----

==== Add Hosts to the Inventory using *tower-cli*

Now that we have the empty inventory created, add your two managed hosts *host1.example.com* and *host2.example.com*, again using *tower-cli*.

TIP: Use *tower-cli* to get the resources you can use it on, then (in this case) *tower-cli host --help* and finally get the proper invocation help with *tower-cli host create --help*.

WARNING: *Solution Below*!

----
[root@control ~]# tower-cli host create --name "host1.example.com" --inventory "Example Inventory"
[root@control ~]# tower-cli host create --name "host2.example.com" --inventory "Example Inventory"
----

==== Add Hosts using *awx-manage*

It's fine to use *tower-cli* to add hosts but there is another way using the command line: *awx-manage* can add hosts by importing existing inventory files. Let's give this a try, too:

First create a new inventory named *Imported Inventory* using *tower-cli* on the control host or from the web UI:

----
[root@control ~]# tower-cli inventory create --name "Imported Inventory" --organization "Default"
----

Then open a SSH session to *tower1.example.com* (or one of the other nodes):

----
[root@control ~]# ssh tower1.example.com
----

And create a file with a simple inventory:

----
host1.example.com
host2.example.com
----

Use *awx-manage* on the Tower node to add the hosts to your *Imported Inventory* inventory:

----
[root@tower1 ~]# awx-manage inventory_import --source=./example_inventory --inventory-name="Imported Inventory"

    1.808 INFO     Updating inventory 2: Example Inventory
    1.910 INFO     Reading Ansible inventory source: /root/example_inventory
    2.764 INFO     Processing JSON output...
    2.764 INFO     Loaded 0 groups, 2 hosts
    2.876 INFO     Inventory import completed for  (Example Inventory - 6) in 1.1s
----

Now go to the web UI of all three Tower nodes and check your *Example Inventory* and *Imported Inventory* exist and both contains the two hosts.

TIP: Take note everything we did so far on one Tower cluster node is automatically replicated to the other cluster nodes.

=== Create Machine Credentials

TIP: SSH keys have already been created and distributed in your lab environment and `sudo` has been setup on the managed hosts to allow password-less login for user *ansible* on *control.example.com*.

Now configure the credentials to access our managed hosts from Tower. As configuring credentials with SSH keys from *tower-cli* on the command line is a bit cumbersome, just this time use the web UI. In one of the Tower web UI under *RESOURCES -> Credentials*:


* Click the image:green_plus.png[20,20] button to add new credentials
* *NAME:* Example Credentials
* *ORGANIZATION:* Default
* *CREDENTIAL TYPE:* Machine
* *USERNAME:* ansible
* *PRIVILEGE ESCALATION METHOD:* sudo

As we are using SSH key authentication, you have to provide an SSH private key that can be used to access the hosts. You could also configure password authentication here.

* Bring up an SSH terminal on *control.example.com*, become user `ansible` and `cat` the SSH private key:
----
[root@control ~]# su - ansible
[ansible@control ~]$ cat .ssh/id_rsa
----

* Copy the complete private key (including "BEGIN" and "END" lines) and paste it into the *SSH PRIVATE KEY* field in the web UI.
* Click *SAVE*

You have now setup credentials to use later for your inventory hosts.

=== It's a Cluster After All

So far nothing special. But we are working in a clustered environment. Login to the other Tower instances Web UIs (the ones you didn't configured the inventory and credentials on). Have a good look around, everything we configured on one Tower instance was synced automatically to the other nodes. Inventory, credentials, all there.

== Run a Job in the Cluster

Before we can start jobs we need to configure some more things. This is again the same as in single-instance Tower deployments, so the guide will just walk you through the required steps. Take note how everything you configure is syncronized to the other nodes again.

Your lab environment includes Gitea, a Git-service that comes with a web ui and much more. Gitea runs on `control.example.com` and can be accessed via HTTP. Go and have a look around by accessing:

*\http://control-<GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com/gitea*.

All repos on Gitea are configured as private e.g. you need to login to access the content. Log in as:

* *User*: git
* *Password*: r3dh4t1!

To configure and use this repository as a *Source Control Management (SCM)* system in Tower you have to:

* Create *Credentials* to access the Git repo
* Create a *Project* that uses the repository

=== Create SCM Credentials

First we have to create credentials again, this time to access the Git repository over HTTP. This credential is user/password based, so feel free to use the web UI again or find out how to use *tower-cli* to create it.

In the Tower web UI go to *Resources->Credentials*. Now:

* Click the image:green_plus.png[20,20] button to add new credentials
* *NAME*: Gitea Control
* *CREDENTIAL TYPE*: Choose *Source Control*

TIP: You will have to change the page in the *SELECT CREDENTIAL TYPE* window.

* *USERNAME*: git
* *PASSWORD*: r3dh4t1!
* Click *SAVE*

If you want to use *tower-cli*:

* Use the help function to find the needed arguments
* The credential type is "Source Control", as "inputs" you need "user" and "password"

WARNING: *SOLUTION BELOW!*

----
[root@control ~]# tower-cli credential create --credential-type="Source Control" \
                    --name="Gitea Credentials" \
                    --inputs='{"username": "git", "password": "r3dh4t1!"}' \
                    --organization="Default"
----
=== Create the Project

Now with the SCM credentials configured, either in the web UI or using *tower-cli* create a *Project* for one of your Gitea repositories.

==== In the web UI

* Go to *Projects* in the side menu view click the image:green_plus.png[20,20] button. Fill in the form:

* *NAME:* Apache
* *ORGANIZATION:* Default
* *SCM TYPE:* Git

Now you need the HTTP URL to access the repo. Go to the Gitea web UI, choose the *Apache* repository and copy the HTTP URL. Enter the URL into the Project configuration:

** *SCM URL:* \http://control.example.com/gitea/git/Apache.git
* *SCM CREDENTIAL:* Gitea Control
* *SCM UPDATE OPTIONS:* Tick all three boxes to always get a fresh copy of the repository and to update the repository when launching a job.
* Click *SAVE*

==== Or Using *tower-cli* on the control host

----
[root@control ~]# tower-cli project create --name="Apache" \
                    --scm-type=git \
                    --scm-url="http://control.example.com/gitea/git/Apache.git" \
                    --scm-credential="Gitea Credentials" \
                    --organization "Default" \
                    --scm-clean --scm-delete-on-update --scm-update-on-launch\
                    --wait
----

TIP: The new Project will be synced after creation automatically.

TIP: You can use `control.example.com` as hostname in *SCM URL* because it resolves inside the environment. For accessing the Gitea web UI in your browser you need to use `\http://control-<GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com/gitea`.

=== Create a Job Template

Before running an Ansible *Job* from your Tower cluster you must create a *Job Template*, again business as usual for Tower users.

==== In the Web UI

* Go to *Templates* in the *RESOURCES* section of the menu, click the image:green_plus.png[20,20] button and choose *Job Template*.

** *NAME:* Install Apache
** *JOB TYPE:* Run
** *INVENTORY:* Example Inventory
** *PROJECT:* Apache
** *PLAYBOOK:* apache_install.yml
** *CREDENTIAL:* Example Credentials
** We need to run the tasks as root so check *Enable privilege escalation*
** Click *SAVE*

==== Or Using *tower-cli*

----
[root@control ~]# tower-cli job_template create \
                    --name="Install Apache" \
                    --inventory="Example Inventory" \
                    --credential="Example Credentials" \
                    --project=Apache \
                    --playbook=apache_install.yml \
                    --become-enabled="yes"
----

=== Run a Job

Now you are ready to start a job in your Tower cluster. In the web UI's *Templates* view select the new Job Template and run it by clicking the rocket icon. Again this is at first not different from a standard Tower.

TIP: But as this is a cluster of active nodes every node could have run the job. And the Job output in Tower's web UI doesn't tell you where it run, just the instance group.

=== So what Instance run the Job? Check the Results!

==== Via command line and curl

But there is help. In one of the Tower instances web UI go to the *Instance Groups* menu item. For the `tower` instance group, the *TOTAL JOBS* counter shows the number of finished jobs. If you click *TOTAL JOBS* you'll get a detailed list of jobs.

To see on what instance a job actually run go back to the *Instance Groups* view. If you click *INSTANCES* under the Tower group, you will get an overview of the *TOTAL JOBS* each Tower instance executed which leads to the job list again.

But it would still be nice to see where a job run (not the other way round) and to get an idea how jobs are distributed to the available instances. For this we have to use the API.

To run a number of jobs (so the cluster has something to distribute) we could just fire of a couple of the Apache job templates, but doing this using the web UI is tiresome. So let's use *tower-cli* to run some jobs, what about just running the *Install Apache* Template five times?

----
[root@control ~]# for i in `seq 1 5`; do tower-cli job launch -J "Install Apache" ; sleep 5 ; done
----

And now query the API for the instance/node the jobs where executed on:

----
[root@tower2 ~]# curl -s -k -u admin:r3dh4t1! https://tower2.example.com/api/v2/jobs/ | python -m json.tool | grep execution_node
            "execution_node": "tower3.example.com",
            "execution_node": "tower1.example.com",
            "execution_node": "tower3.example.com",
            "execution_node": "tower2.example.com",
            "execution_node": "tower2.example.com",
----

Now you can see how the Tower cluster distributed the jobs between the instances! And for the fun of it you can of course change the Tower instance to query in the `curl` command and see that you get the same information.

==== Via API in the browser

The Tower API can also be opened in the browser. Find the job you just executed in `https://tower1.example.com/#/jobs` and remember the number. Now opene the job via the API interface: open the URL `https://tower1.example.com/api/v2/jobs/<NUMBER>/` where `<NUMBER>` is the number of the job you just looked up in the UI. Search the page for the string `execution_node`, the tower instance on which the job was executed is listed there.

== Tower Instance Groups

Ansible Tower clustering was introduced with Tower 3.1 and allows you to easily add capacity to your Tower infrastructure by adding nodes. What it doesn't allow is to dedicate capacity or nodes to a purpose, be it a group of people, a department or a location. In a single-group Tower cluster where all nodes are within the `tower` group there is no way to influence what node will run a job, as you saw the cluster will take care of scheduling Jobs on nodes as it sees fit.

To enable more control over what node is running a job, Tower 3.2 saw the introduction of the instance groups feature. Instance groups allow you to organize your cluster nodes into groups. In turn Jobs can be assigned to Instance Groups by configuring the Groups in Organizations, Inventories or Job Templates.

TIP: The order of priority is Job Template > Inventory > Organization. So Instance Groups configured in Job Templates take precedence over those configured in Inventories, which take precedence over Organizations

Some things to keep in mind about Instance Groups:

* Nodes in an Instance Group share a job queue
* You can have as many Instance Groups as you like as long as there is at least one node in the `tower` group
* Nodes can be in one or more Instance Groups
* Group can not be named `instance_group_tower`!
* Tower instances can't have the same name as a group

This allows for some pretty cool setups, e.g. you could have some nodes shared over the whole cluster (by putting them into all groups) but then have other nodes that are dedicated to one group to reserve some capacity.

WARNING: Remember the base `tower` group does house keeping like processing events from jobs for all groups so the node count of this group has to scale with your overall cluster load, even if these nodes are not used to run Jobs.

Talking about the `tower` group: As you have learned this group is crucial for the operations of a Tower cluster. Apart from the house keeping tasks, if a resource is not associated with an Instance Group, one of the nodes from the `tower` group will run the Job. So if there are no operational nodes in the base group, the cluster will not be able to run Jobs.

WARNING: It is important to have enough nodes in the `tower` group

TIP: Here is a really great blog post going into Instance Groups with a lot more depth: https://www.ansible.com/blog/ansible-tower-feature-spotlight-instance-groups-and-isolated-nodes.

=== Creating Instance Groups

Having the introduction out of the way, let's get back to our lab and give Instance Groups a try. First have a look at our setup as described in the installers inventory file. In your SSH session change into the Ansible installer directory and do the following:

----
[root@control ansible-tower-setup-bundle-3.2.5-1.el7]# cat inventory
[tower]
tower1.example.com
tower2.example.com
tower3.example.com

[database]
towerdb.example.com

[...]
----

In this basic cluster setup we just have the `tower` base group. Let's configure two new Instance groups and add Tower instances. As an example scenario we'll take one node out of the `tower` group and share another node between groups.

WARNING: This is not best practice, it's just for the sake of this lab! Any jobs that are launched targeting a group without active nodes will be stuck in a waiting state until instances become available. So one-instance groups are never a good idea.

The global tower group can still be associated with a resource, just like any of the custom instance groups defined in the playbook. This can be used to specify a preferred instance group on the job template or inventory, but still allow the job to be submitted to any instance if those are out of capacity.

Instance groups are prefixed with `instance_group_`. Adapt the inventory groups to make it look like this:

----
[root@control ansible-tower-setup-bundle-3.2.5-1.el7]# cat inventory
[tower]
tower1.example.com
tower2.example.com

[instance_group_prod]
tower3.example.com

[instance_group_dev]
tower2.example.com

[database]
towerdb.example.com

[...]
----

After editing the inventory, start the installer to make the desired changes:

----
[root@control ansible-tower-setup-bundle-3.2.5-1.el7]# ./setup.sh
----

=== Verify Instance Groups

==== Via cli

----
[root@control ~]# tower-cli instance_group list
== ===== ======== =================
id name  capacity consumed_capacity
== ===== ======== =================
 1 tower      171                 0
== ===== ======== =================
----

==== Via API

Open the URL `https://tower1.example.com/api/v2/instance_groups/` in your browser. You can also use curl to access the API from the command line:

----
[root@control ~]# curl -s -k -u admin:r3dh4t1! https://tower2.example.com/api/v2/instance_groups/| python -m json.tool
{
    "count": 1,
    "next": null,
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
        {
            "capacity": 171,
            "committed_capacity": 0,
            "consumed_capacity": 0,
            "controller": null,
            "created": "2019-03-01T16:39:08.293548Z",
            "id": 1,
            "instances": 3,
            "jobs_running": 0,
            "jobs_total": 150,
            "modified": "2019-03-01T16:39:08.343125Z",
            "name": "tower",
            "percent_capacity_remaining": 100.0,
            "policy_instance_list": [
                "tower3.example.com",
                "tower1.example.com",
                "tower2.example.com"
            ],
            "policy_instance_minimum": 0,
            "policy_instance_percentage": 0,
            "related": {
                "instances": "/api/v2/instance_groups/1/instances/",
                "jobs": "/api/v2/instance_groups/1/jobs/"
            },
            "type": "instance_group",
            "url": "/api/v2/instance_groups/1/"
        }
    ]
}
----

==== In the GUI, see Details

Open the URL `https://tower3.example.com/#/instance_groups` in your browser.

In the instance group overview details of the group itself and number of jobs are listed. Also the current capacity of the instance group is shown in a live view, thus providing a quick insight if there are capacity problems.

Next to each instance is a "ON" button shown, image:on_off.png[20,20]. This deactivates the corresponding instance and prevents that further jobs are assigned to it. Running jobs on an instance which is set to "OFF" are finished in a normal way. Further to the right a slider can change the amount of RAM and thus the amount of forks scheduled on an instance. This way it is possible to influence in which ratio roughly the jobs are assigned.

== Start Parallel Jobs across Instances

The real power of the instance groups is revealed when multiple jobs are started, and they are assigned to different Tower nodes. To launch multiple jobs we will set up a workflow with multiple concurrent jobs. In our case we focus on security compliance like STIG, CIS and so on. Often these compliance rules are enforced by executing an Ansible task per each requirement. This makes documentation and audit easier. These compliance requirements are often grouped into certain independend categories. The tasks of those can often be executed in parallel because they do not conflict with each other. In a production system this needs to be verified on a task by task base of course.

In our demo case we provided three playbooks which:

* ensure the absence of a few packages (STIG)
* ensure configuration of PAM and login cryptography (STIG)
* ensure absence of services and kernel modules (CIS).

The playbooks can be found in the "omcpliance" repository on gitea: `http://control.example.com/gitea/git/compliance`.

=== Add Repository to Tower

The compliance repository needs to be added as project. Since this was done already in an earlier chapter via GUI, we will now focus on using the `tower-cli` tool for this. It has a resource type `project` and can thus create, change and delete projects. In our case we are going to create a new project (`create`), set the name (`-n`) and the organization (`--organization`) and provide the repository details type (`scm-type`) und (`scm-url`). Also we can set typical configuration options so that the project is updated upon the launch of related templtaes (`--scm-update-on-launch`) and that it is imported clean (`--scm-clean`). Since our Gitea instance requires authentication, we also include the correct credentials (`--scm-credentials`).

----
[root@control ~]# tower-cli project create -n "Compliance Repository" \
                    --organization Default \
                    --scm-type git \
                    --scm-url http://control.example.com/gitea/git/compliance.git \
                    --scm-clean 1 \
                    --scm-update-on-launch 1 \
                    --scm-credential "Gitea Credentials"
Resource changed.

As it can be seen calling tower-cli is much faster then to click through multiple steps in a web interface.

=== Create three Templates

As mentioned the repository contains three playbooks to enforce different compliance measurements. To avoid clicking too much we again create these three templates via `tower-cli`. Note that the commands will look very similar since project (`--project`), inventory (`--inventory`), machine credentials (`--credential`), become setting (`--become-enabled`) and job type (`--job-type`) will all be the same. Only the name (`--name`) and the actual playbook (`--playbook`) will be different.

----
[root@control ~]# tower-cli job_template create -n "Compliance STIG packages" \
                    --job-type run -i "Example Inventory" \
                    --project "Compliance Repository" \
                    --playbook "stig-packages.yml" \
                    --credential "Example Credentials" \
                    --become-enabled 1

=== Create Parallel Workflow

To enable a parallel execution of all these job templates, we will create a workflow out of them. Workflows are configured in the *Templates* view, you might have noticed you can choose between *Job Template* and *Workflow Template* when adding a template so this is finally making sense.

* Go to the *Templates* view and click the image:green_plus.png[20,20] button. This time choose *Workflow Template*
** *NAME:* Compliance Workflow
** *ORGANIZATION:* Default
* Click *SAVE*
* Now the *WORKFLOW VISUALIZER* button becomes active, click it to start the graphical editor.
* Click on the *START* button, a new node opens. To the right you can assign an action to the node, you can choose between *JOBS*, *PROJECT SYNC* and *INVENTORY SYNC*.
* In this lab we'll link multiple jobs to the *START*, so select the *Compliance STIG package* job and click *SELECT*. The node gets annotated with the name of the job.
* Click on the *START* button, another new node opens.
* Select the *Compliance STIG config* job and click *SELECT*. The node gets annotated with the name of the job.
* Click on the *START* button, another new node opens.
* Select the *Compliance CIS* job and click *SELECT*. The node gets annotated with the name of the job.
* Click *SAVE*

=== Execute and Watch

Your workflow is ready to go, launch it.

* In the *Templates* view launch the *Compliance Workflow* by clicking the rocket icon.
* Wait until the job has finished.

Go back to the instance view and watch that each instance is running at least one job.

After the workflow was finished, deactivate tower1 with the image:on_off.png[20,20] button and wait until it is shown as deactivated. Go back to the list of templates, launch the workflow "Compliance Workflow" again, get back to the instance overview and see that the playbooks are launched on the missing instances.

Activate tower1 again by pressing image:on_off.png[20,20] a second time.

== Isolated Nodes



== Advanced Inventories

=== Dynamic Inventories

Quite often just using static inventories will not be enough. You might be dealing with ever-changing cloud environments or you have to get your managed systems from a CMDB or other sources of truth.

Tower includes built-in support for syncing dynamic inventory from cloud sources such as Amazon AWS, Google Compute Engine, among others. Tower also offers the ability to use custom scripts to pull from your own inventory source.

In this chapter you'll get started with dynamic inventories in Tower. Aside from the build-in sources you can write inventory scripts in any programming/scripting language that you have installed on the Tower machine. To keep it easy we'll use a simple custom inventory script using... the Bash shell.

==== The Inventory Source

First you need a source. In real life this would be your cloud provider, your CMDB or what not. For the sake of this lab we have the web server on control.example.com configured to be our source.

Open an SSH session from the control host to one of your Tower-Nodes and query your external inventory source:

----
[root@tower1-REPL ~]# curl control.example.com:/pub/inventory_list
{
    "dyngroup":{
        "hosts":[
            "cloud1.cloud.example.com",
            "cloud2.cloud.example.com"
        ],
        "vars":{
            "var1": true
        }
    },
    "_meta":{
        "hostvars":{
            "cloud1.cloud.example.com":{
                "type":"web"
            },
            "cloud2.cloud.example.com":{
                "type":"database"
            }
        }
    }
}
----

Well, this is handy, the output is already configured as JSON like Ansible would expect... ;-) Okay, seriously, in real life your script would likely get some information from your source system, format it as JSON and return the data to Tower.

==== The Custom Inventory Script

An inventory scripts has to follow some conventions. It must accept the *--list* and *--host <hostname>* arguments. When it is called with *--list*, the script must output a JSON-encoded data containing all groups to be managed. When called with *--host <hostname>* it must return an JSON-formatted hash or dictionary of host variables (can be empty).

As looping over all hosts and calling the script with *--host* can be pretty slow, it is possible to return a top level element called "_meta" with all of the host variables in one script run. And this is what we'll do. So this is our custom inventory script:

----
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$1" == "--list" ] ; then
  curl control.example.com:/pub/inventory_list
elif [ "$1" == "--host" ]; then
  echo '{"_meta": {"hostvars": {}}}'
else
  echo "{ }"
fi
----

What it basically does is to return the data collected by curl when called with *--list* and as the data includes *_meta* information about the host variables Ansible will not call it with *--host*. The curl command is of course the place where your script  would get data by whatever means, format it as proper JSON and return it.

As simple as it gets, right? More information can be found https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_inventory.html[here]

So now you have a source of (slightly faked) inventory data and a script to fetch and pass it to Tower. Now you need to get this into Tower.

==== Integrate into Tower

The first step is to add the inventory script to Tower:

* In the web UI, open *RESOURCES->Inventory Scripts*.
* To create a new custom inventory script, click the image:green_plus.png[20,20] button.
* Fill in the needed data:
** *NAME:* Cloud Inventory
** Copy the Bash script from above and paste it into the *CUSTOM SCRIPT* field
* Click *SAVE*

Finally the new inventory script can be used in an actual *Inventory*.

* Go to *RESOURCES->Inventories*
* Click the image:green_plus.png[20,20] button and choose *Inventory*.
* *NAME:* Cloud Inventory
* Click *SAVE*
* Click the *SOURCES* button on top, the image:green_plus.png[20,20] to add a new source
* *NAME:* Cloud Custom Script*
* From the *SOURCE* drop-down choose *Custom Script*
* Now the dialog for the source opens, your custom script should already be selected in the *CUSTOM INVENTORY SCRIPT*.
* Under *UPDATE OPTIONS* check *Overwrite* and *Overwrite Variables*
* Click *SAVE*

To sync your new source into the inventory:

* Open the *Cloud Inventory* again
* Click the *SOURCES* button
* To the left click the circular arrow to start the sync process for your custom source.
* After the sync has finished click the *HOSTS* button.

You should now see a list of hosts according to what you got from the curl command above. Click the hosts to make sure the host variables are there, too.

==== Now to the Dynamic Part...

To mimic the dynamic nature of the inventory, adapt the file we are using as source.

* Open an SSH session to your control host (if it's not open anyway).
* Edit the file `/var/www/html/pub/inventory_list` to look like this (i.e. add another host):

----
{
    "dyngroup":{
        "hosts":[
            "cloud1.cloud.example.com",
            "cloud2.cloud.example.com",
            "cloud3.cloud.example.com"
        ],
        "vars":{
            "var1": true
        }
    },
    "_meta":{
        "hostvars":{
            "cloud1.cloud.example.com":{
                "type":"web"
            },
            "cloud2.cloud.example.com":{
                "type":"database"
            },
            "cloud3.cloud.example.com":{
                "type":"database"
            }
        }
    }
}
----

After saving the file:

* Go back to web UI, open the *Cloud Inventory* inventory
* Click the *SOURCES* button and re-sync the *Cloud Custom Script* source.
* Open the *HOSTS* view again and make sure you have three hosts listed.
